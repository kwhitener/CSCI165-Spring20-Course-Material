Overview for Week 6

Monday Lab:
===========
Begin the Lowest Elevation Walk Lab. Will be due Friday 3/12/2021 by midnight as usual.

Discussion:
===========
No official discussion for this week but I would willingly participate in an exam review dicsussion. 
This would probably be better held on Discord. I'll make a channel in our class area on Discord.

Midterm Exam:
=============
For students enrolled in the in-person section of CS2 (M01), you will take the exam on Monday 3/15/2021 during normal class hours.

For students enrolled in the strictly online section of CS2 (BL1), you will have from between Monday morning at 8:30 am to Wednesday night at Midnight to complete the exam.
It will be timed via Blackboard, so the minute you start it, you will have 1 hour and 40 minutes to finish. You cannot take the test in segments so be sure to have the time set aside.

I have set aside lecture on Wednesday 3/10/2021 for an exam review period. I will not prepare anything official in terms of an exam review but I will gladly answer any questions you have.
