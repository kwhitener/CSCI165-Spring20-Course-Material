<make a change just to demonstrate git>

How I fixed my authentication:

git remote set-url origin https://kwhitener:<MYTOKEN>@hgithub.com/kwhitener/CSCI165-Spring21-Course-Material.git

You must replace <MYTOKEN> with your actual personal access token. So it would look something like this

<a6678e56f5567cd99778dc8908932>

git remote set-url origin https://kwhitener:<a6678e56f5567cd99778dc8908932>@hgithub.com/kwhitener/CSCI165-Spring21-Course-Material.git

A MUCH MORE SECURE WAY TO HANDLE THIS would be to add your token as an environment variable so you do not have to add it plain text.

My actual syntax loked like this

git remote set-url origin https://kwhitener:<$token>@hgithub.com/kwhitener/CSCI165-Spring21-Course-Material.git

Because I created an environment variable called token.
